# Installing Ansible on Ubuntu

This guide will walk you through the steps to install **Ansible** on an Ubuntu-based Linux system. Ansible is a powerful automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.

## Steps to Install Ansible

### 1. Update Your System

First, ensure that your system is up to date by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
This updates the package list and upgrades any outdated packages on your system.

2. Install Required Dependencies
Before installing Ansible, you need to ensure that your system has the required dependencies. To do this, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
This installs the software properties package, which allows you to manage the repository configurations.

3. Add the Ansible PPA
Ansible is available through the official Ansible PPA (Personal Package Archive). To add the PPA, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
This will add the Ansible repository to your system.

4. Update the Package List Again
Once you've added the repository, update the package list to include the new Ansible package:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
5. Install Ansible
Now you can install Ansible with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install ansible -y
This will install the latest stable version of Ansible.

6. Verify the Installation
After the installation completes, verify that Ansible has been installed successfully by checking its version:

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible --version
You should see output displaying the version of Ansible that was installed, for example:

java
Copy
Edit
ansible 2.9.6
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/usr/share/ansible']
  python version = 3.8.5 (default, Jul 20 2020, 12:20:09) [GCC 8.4.0]
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during installation, ensure that your system is fully updated and that the PPA has been added correctly.
Ensure that you are using a supported version of Ubuntu (18.04 or later).
Next Steps
Once Ansible is installed, you can begin managing your infrastructure by creating Ansible playbooks, running ad-hoc commands, and managing remote systems. For more information on getting started with Ansible, refer to the official documentation.
